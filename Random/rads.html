    <h2 class="section-title">My Skills</h2>
    <div class="skills-content">
      <p>Throughout my journey as a Computer Programming student, I’ve developed a dynamic set of skills that empower me to solve problems, collaborate effectively, and continuously evolve in a fast-paced tech landscape. My abilities span both technical and creative domains, allowing me to approach challenges with precision and innovation.</p>

      <p>Whether I’m writing clean code, debugging complex logic, or presenting ideas to a team, I strive to bring clarity, efficiency, and purpose to everything I do. I believe that true skill isn’t just about knowing tools—it’s about using them to build meaningful solutions and grow alongside others.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">My Interests</h2>
    <div class="interest-content">
      <p>Beyond programming, I pursue a variety of interests that not only fuel my creativity but also shape the way I approach technology and problem-solving.</p>

      <div class="interest-image">
        <img src="MI 2.jpg" alt="Photography at Church Events">
        <p><strong>Photography at Church Events</strong> – I find immense joy in capturing meaningful moments—whether it's the quiet reverence of a prayer, the vibrant energy of a celebration, or the subtle expressions that tell stories words can't. Photography allows me to document the spirit of community and faith, and it’s become a powerful way for me to express emotion and narrative through visuals.</p>
      </div>

      <p>I'm also deeply fascinated by <strong>emerging tech gadgets</strong>. Whether it's testing out the latest smart devices or exploring experimental tools, I love diving into how technology evolves and how it can be harnessed to improve everyday life. This curiosity often leads me to discover new platforms, apps, and hardware that inspire my own development projects.</p>

      <p>In my downtime, I enjoy <strong>strategy games</strong> that challenge my logic and decision-making. Games like chess, tower defense, or resource management simulators sharpen my analytical thinking and help me stay mentally agile—skills that translate directly into coding and debugging.</p>

      <p>Finally, I’m an active member of <strong>online coding communities</strong>, where I engage in discussions, share ideas, and learn from fellow developers around the world. These spaces keep me connected to industry trends, new frameworks, and collaborative opportunities. They also remind me that learning is a lifelong journey, and that innovation thrives when minds come together.</p>
